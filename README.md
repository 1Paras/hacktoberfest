## Git-Flow
Improved [Git-flow](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)

### Index
* [Setup](#setup)
* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Features](#features)
* [Make a Release](#make-a-release)
* [Hotfixes](#hotfixes)
* [Commands](#commands)

<hr>

### Setup
###### You need a working git installation as prerequisite. Git flow works on OSX, Linux and Windows.

##### OSX Homebrew:
```
$ brew install git-flow-avh
```

##### OSX Macports:
```
$ port install git-flow
```

##### Linux (Debian-based):
```
$ sudo apt-get install git-flow
```

##### Windows (Cygwin):
###### You need wget and util-linux to install git-flow.
```bash
$ wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install <state> | bash
```
<hr>

### Getting Started
###### Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup. Start using git-flow by initializing it inside an existing git repository:
##### Initialize:
###### You'll have to answer a few questions regarding the naming conventions for your branches. It's recommended to use the default values.
```shell
git flow init
```
OR
###### To use default
```shell
git flow init -d
```
<hr>

### Features
###### Develop new features for upcoming releases. Typically exist in developers repos only.
##### Start a new feature:
###### This action creates a new feature branch based on 'develop' and switches to it.
```
git flow feature start MYFEATURE
```

##### Finish up a feature:
###### Finish the development of a feature. This action performs the following:
###### 1) Merged MYFEATURE into 'develop'.
###### 2) Removes the feature branch.
###### 3) Switches back to 'develop' branch
```
git flow feature finish MYFEATURE
```

##### Publish a feature:
###### Are you developing a feature in collaboration? Publish a feature to the remote server so it can be used by other users.
```
git flow feature publish MYFEATURE
```

##### Getting a published feature:
###### Get a feature published by another user.
```
git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE
```

##### Tracking a origin feature:
###### You can track a feature on origin by using
```
git flow feature track MYFEATURE
```
<hr>

### Make a Release
###### Support preparation of a new production release. Allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release

##### Start a release:
###### To start a release, use the git flow release command. It creates a release branch created from the 'develop' branch. You can optionally supply a [BASE] commit sha-1 hash to start the release from. The commit must be on the 'develop' branch.
```
git flow release start RELEASE [BASE]
```
###### It's wise to publish the release branch after creating it to allow release commits by other developers. Do it similar to feature publishing with the command:
```
git flow release publish RELEASE
```
###### (You can track a remote release with the: ```git flow release track RELEASE``` command)

##### Finish up a release:
###### Finishing a release is one of the big steps in git branching. It performs several actions:
###### 1) Merges the release branch back into 'master'
###### 2) Tags the release with its name
###### 3) Back-merges the release into 'develop'
###### 4) Removes the release branch
```
git flow release finish RELEASE
```
###### Don't forget to push your tags with ```git push --tags```

<hr>

### Hotfixes
###### Hotfixes arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. May be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.

##### Git flow hotfix start:
###### Like the other git flow commands, a hotfix is started with
```
$ git flow hotfix start VERSION [BASENAME]
```
###### The version argument hereby marks the new hotfix release name. Optionally you can specify a basename to start from.

##### Finish a hotfix:
###### By finishing a hotfix it gets merged back into develop and master. Additionally the master merge is tagged with the hotfix version
```
git flow hotfix finish VERSION
```
<hr>

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How to Contribute Here?
Make sure you follow the following simple set of rules here while trying to contribute.
- Every Pull Request must have a title.
- Every Pull Request must have a description.
- Write the title and description of what you have done in the imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone.
    - ‚úÖ **DO**: Start the line with "Fix", "Add", "Change".
    - üö´ **DON'T**: Start with "Fixed", "Added", "Adding", "Changed".
    - üéØ Read ‚Üí [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- Don't end the summary line with a period - it's a title and titles don't end with a period.
- Have fun.
